Suppose you’re working in a parts manufacturing plant, and you’re running quality analysis on the gasket production line. Gaskets produced by your company will be defective 1% of the time, and are distributed in packs of 20.
Your company has a policy where if 2 or more of the 20 gaskets in a given pack is defective, they will replace the entire package. What proportion of packages does the company need to replace?

Use Binomial Distribution forumla 
where 
n = number of trials
x = number of success
p = prob of success
q = 1 -q, prob of failure

n = 20 (gaskets per package)
p = 0.01
q = 0.99

#the probability of having more than 2 broken gaskets
P(x >=2) = 1 - P(x = 0) - P(x = 1)
